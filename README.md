# Sudoku CLI (Python) — V1 to V2

A Sudoku project built in Python step-by-step, starting from a basic playable CLI version (V1) and upgrading it into a solver-based version (V2) using the Backtracking algorithm.

The goal of this repo is learning-by-building: Python fundamentals, clean project structure, input validation, and algorithmic problem solving.

## Versions

This repository contains **two versions** of the project:

```txt
sudoku_py/
│── v1_cli/        # playable Sudoku CLI game
